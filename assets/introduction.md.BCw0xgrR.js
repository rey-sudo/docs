Each token represents an individual discount (1 token = 1 beneficiary).

The buyer sees the option to redeem the token as a discount in the right panel. If the user agrees to do so, they only need to pay the discounted price.</p><p>When the buyer makes the purchase, the transaction sends the redeemable token to the individual contract that handles the trade logic. When the commerce ends, the contract that handles the trade logic sends the redeemable token to the seller who can redeem it for ADA.

This would then generate at least 200,000 ADA annually and 16,666 ADA monthly returned to all holders in the form of a discount. This is a decent achievement.</p><p>In addition, the amount generated by the fee for each sale must be added. Averaging the fee charged by large private e-commerce companies 10% for each sale of any type of product is a realistic and understandable percentage.
